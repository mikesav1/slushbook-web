<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial request was to build a new Admin Translation Editor feature. Over the course of the session, the scope expanded significantly to include five major new features and, finally, to address a series of UI/UX bugs reported by the user in the German version of the application.

The full list of user requests addressed in this session:
1.  **P0: Implement Admin Translation Editor:** Build a UI for admins to edit i18n language files directly in the app.
2.  **P1: Language-based Product Links:** Ensure product links are filtered based on the user's selected language/country.
3.  **P2: In-app Notifications:** Implement a full notification system with a bell icon and dropdown for events like comments and favorites.
4.  **P3: Badges/Achievements System:** Create a system to award users badges based on the number of recipes they create.
5.  **P4: Google OAuth Integration:** Add a Continue with Google login option using an Emergent-managed solution.
6.  **P5: Pro-User Sharing Feature:** Allow Pro users to share private recipes via a unique, revocable link.
7.  **Bug Fixes:** After the features were built, the user tested the app in German and reported several issues: mixed Danish/German text, broken tooltips, and a misaligned user profile dropdown menu.

**User's preferred language**: Danish. The next agent MUST respond in Danish.

**what currently exists?**
The application is a feature-rich full-stack recipe platform. All five major features (Admin Editor, Notifications, Badges, Google OAuth, Pro-Sharing) have been fully implemented, tested, and verified by the user.

The agent was in the middle of addressing a list of UI/UX bugs reported by the user for the German language version. The misaligned dropdown and the broken tooltip system have been successfully fixed. The main remaining issue is incomplete internationalization, with some UI elements still showing hardcoded Danish text instead of German. The agent was actively working on translating the  when the session ended.

**Last working item**:
The agent was in the process of fixing incomplete translations in the German UI, as reported by the user. The focus was on the  page, which was almost entirely hardcoded in Danish.

- **Last item agent was working:** Internationalizing the . The agent identified all the hardcoded Danish text, generated the corresponding translation keys in a JSON format for both Danish and German, and was about to update the language files and refactor the component.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** Screenshot tool. After implementing the fix, the agent should navigate to the  page while the language is set to German and take a screenshot to verify that all text has been translated correctly.
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1 (P0):** Incomplete internationalization in the German UI.
-   **Issue 2 (P2):** User cannot save to GitHub.

**Issues Detail:**
-   **Issue 1: Incomplete internationalization in the German UI.**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent has already started fixing this by preparing translation keys for the . It also successfully fixed the related tooltip system bug, which the user confirmed is now working correctly.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Resume work on .
        2.  Use the prepared JSON to update  and  with the new  section.
        3.  Refactor  to replace all hardcoded text elements with the  translation function (e.g., ).
        4.  Perform a global search () across all  files in the frontend for common Danish words (Opskrift, Tilbage, Gem) to find any other remaining hardcoded text.
        5.  Translate any newly found keys and add them to all language files.
        6.  Test the  page and any other fixed pages in German using the screenshot tool.

**Last 5 User Messages and any pending user messages**
1.  **User Report:** The user tested the German version and found several bugs: mixed languages, broken tooltips, and a misaligned user dropdown. (Status: Work In Progress)
2.  **User Report 2:** The user tried to restart the tooltips, but they only appeared briefly on some pages and then disappeared. (Status: Resolved by agent)
3.  **User Confirmation:** The user confirmed that after the agent's latest fix, the entire tooltip tour now runs correctly. (Status: Resolved)
4.  **User Next Step:** The user stated that the next step is to fix the remaining places where Danish text is still visible. (Status: Work In Progress)
5.  **User Clarification:** The user gave more detail on the tooltip issue, which was subsequently fixed. (Status: Resolved)

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken:** The internationalization for the German language is incomplete, with hardcoded Danish text appearing in several places.
-   **Mocked:** None.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** NO. The agent primarily used the screenshot tool and relied on extensive manual testing feedback from the user.
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** YES, once for an authentication issue. The analysis pointed to an empty database, which helped the agent pivot to asking the user for correct login credentials.
-   **Test files created:** None.
-   **Known regressions:** The recent feature work seems to have caused regressions in the German internationalization, which is now being fixed.
